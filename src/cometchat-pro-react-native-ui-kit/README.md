CometChat React Native UI Kit is a collection of custom UI Components designed to build text chat and voice/video calling features in your application.

The UI Kit is developed to keep developers in mind and aims to reduce development efforts significantly.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have met the following requirements:

- A text editor. (e.g. [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/), [Notepad++](https://notepad-plus-plus.org/), [Sublime Text](https://www.sublimetext.com/), [Atom](https://atom.io/), or [VIM](https://www.vim.org/))

- [Node](https://nodejs.org/)

- [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/get-npm)

- [React-Native](https://reactnative.dev/docs/environment-setup)

| <div align="left"><span>**Note:**<span style="font-weight:500"> Support for Expo CLI based apps.</span> </span></div>                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| If you are using Expo CLI to build a React Native app, the calling component will not work as our calling component needs native-level changes.However, you can create a React Native app using React Native CLI or use the 'expo eject' command to convert your app from an expo-managed workflow to a bare workflow. |

## 2. Configure CometChat inside your app

### i. Initialize CometChat ðŸŒŸ

The `init()` method initializes the settings required for CometChat.
We suggest calling the `init()` method on app startup, preferably in the `created()` method of the Application class.

```javascript
import { CometChat } from "@cometchat-pro/react-native-chat";

const appID = "APP_ID";
const region = "REGION";
const appSetting = new CometChat.AppSettingsBuilder()
  .subscribePresenceForAllUsers()
  .setRegion(region)
  .build();
CometChat.init(appID, appSetting).then(
  () => {
    console.log("Initialization completed successfully");
    // You can now call login function.
  },
  (error) => {
    console.log("Initialization failed with error:", error);
    // Check the reason for error and take appropriate action.
  }
);
```

**Note:**</br>

- Replace APP_ID and REGION with your CometChat `App ID` and `Region` in the above code.

### ii. Login your user ðŸ‘¤

This method takes `UID` and `Auth Key` as input parameters and returns the User object containing all the information of the logged-in user..

```javascript
import { CometChat } from "@cometchat-pro/react-native-chat";

const authKey = "AUTH_KEY";
const uid = "SUPERHERO1";

CometChat.login(uid, authKey).then(
  (user) => {
    console.log("Login Successful:", { user });
  },
  (error) => {
    console.log("Login failed with exception:", { error });
  }
);
```

**Note:** </br>

- Replace `AUTH_KEY` with your CometChat `Auth Key` in the above code.

- We have setup 5 users for testing having UIDs: `SUPERHERO1`, `SUPERHERO2`, `SUPERHERO3`,`SUPERHERO4` and `SUPERHERO5`.

<br/>

## 3. Add UI Kit to your project

- Clone this repository.
- Copy the `react-native-chat-ui-kit` folder to your source folder.
- Copy all the peer dependencies from package.json into your project's package.json and install them using `npm install`.

<br/>

## 4. Launch CometChat

**CometChatUI** is an option to launch a fully functional chat application using the UI Kit. In CometChatUI all the UI Components are interlinked and work together to launch a fully functional chat on your React Native application.

Usage of application in project

```javascript
import React from "react";
import { View } from "react-native";
import { CometChatUI } from "../cometchat-pro-react-native-ui-kit";

export default function CometChatUIView() {
  return (
    <View style={{ flex: 1 }}>
      <CometChatUI />
    </View>
  );
}
```
