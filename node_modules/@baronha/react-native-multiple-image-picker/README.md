React Native Multiple Image Picker enables application to pick images and videos from multiple smart album in iOS/Android, similar to the current Facebook App. React Native Multiple Image Picker is based on two libraries available, [TLPhotoPicker](https://github.com/tilltue/TLPhotoPicker) and [PictureSelector](https://github.com/LuckSiege/PictureSelector)

### iOS

> Don't forget the Privacy Description in `info.plist` and add file [.swift](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/52536380/why-linker-link-static-libraries-with-errors-ios) in your project (and create bridging header file swift).

cd ios/ && pod install
```

#### Issue

When installing this library on Xcode 12, you'll get the following error in Xcode:

```
Undefined symbol: (extension in UIKit):
__C.UIMenu.init(title: Swift.String, image: __C.UIImage?, identifier: __C.UIMenuIdentifier?, options: __C.UIMenuOptions, children: [__C.UIMenuElement]) -> __C.UIMenu

Undefined symbol: (extension in UIKit):
__C.UIAction.init(title: Swift.String, image: __C.UIImage?, identifier: __C.UIActionIdentifier?, discoverabilityTitle: Swift.String?, attributes: __C.UIMenuElementAttributes, state: __C.UIMenuElementState, handler: (__C.UIAction) -> ()) -> __C.UIAction
```

Here are some related issues in the RN repo: [Issue 30202](https://github.com/facebook/react-native/pull/30202) and [Issue 29178](https://github.com/facebook/react-native/pull/29178). This bug could be fixed in a future version of react native, but a workaround I've found is to do the following:

<img src="./files/resolve-error-iOS.png">

1. Open your `ios/project.xcworkspace` project.
2. In the project navigator panel (located on the right side of Xcode), select your project group (i.e. the item with the blueprint icon).
3. The Xcode project editor should appear. In the left panel, under the "Project" section, select your project (if it isn't already selected).
4. In the project section's top tab bar, select the "Build Settings" tab (also make sure the "All" and "Combined" tabs are selected).
5. In the project navigator list, under the "Search Path" section, there should be a "Library Search Paths" setting (alternatively, you can search for "Library Search Paths" in the search bar).
6. Change the entry `"$(TOOLCHAIN_DIR)/usr/lib/swift-5.0/$(PLATFORM_NAME)"` to `"$(TOOLCHAIN_DIR)/usr/lib/swift-5.3/$(PLATFORM_NAME)"` i.e. change `swift-5.0` to `swift-5.3` (to show the popup dialog, double click the value/item).

   - Alternatively, according to this [issue comment](https://github.com/facebook/react-native/issues/29246#issuecomment-667518920), you can clear all the items listed in the "Library Search Paths" setting. **TLDR**: Xcode automatically manages this setting, and the RN template hardcodes it to use Swift 5.0.

7. If you haven't already, make sure to create an empty swift file. Then clean the build folder (the option is in the menu bar under: "Product" -> "Clean Build Folder") and try building your project again.
8. If you are still having problems building the app, try the following and build your project again:
   - Try clearing out Xcode's `derivedData` directory: `rm -rf ~/Library/Developer/Xcode/DerivedData/*` (check out this [gist](https://gist.github.com/maciekish/66b6deaa7bc979d0a16c50784e16d697) for instructions on how to clean up Xcode)
   - Try clearing out the `Cocoapods` cache: `rm -rf "${HOME}/Library/Caches/CocoaPods"` (and then try running `pod install` again).

### Android

> Add Permission in `AndroidManifest.xml`

```xml
    <uses-permission android:name="android.permission.CAMERA" />
    <uses-permission android:name="android.permission.WRITE_EXTERNAL_STORAGE" />
    <uses-permission android:name="android.permission.READ_EXTERNAL_STORAGE" />
```

#### selectedAssets (Important)

Get an Array value only(Only works when ```singleSelectedMode === false```). If you want React Native Multiple Image Picker to re-select previously selected images / videos, you need to add “selectedAssets” in [options](#Options). Perhaps I say a little bit confusing. See [Example](https://github.com/baronha/react-native-multiple-image-picker/tree/main/example) for more details.
